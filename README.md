# Vector Search Engine – Semantic Movie Search

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to build a **semantic search engine for movies** using **LLM embeddings** and a **vector database (ChromaDB)**.  
Instead of relying only on keyword matching (e.g., exact movie titles), the system uses embeddings to capture the **semantic meaning of movie descriptions, genres, or user queries**.  

Example: A user searches for *“a sci-fi film about space and survival”* →  
the system can return **Interstellar**, **The Martian**, or **Gravity**, even if the exact words aren’t in the query.
